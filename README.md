ElephantPocket â€” app for managing home budget. Demo available [here](https://elephant-pocket.surge.sh/).

## Project cancelled

This project has been launched in educational purposes only. I've started it about a year ago and stopped developing in Dec 2019, because I've started writing app for my degree ([you can find it here](https://github.com/GustawTanski/christoffel-symbols-visualization)). There is no point in relaunching it now though I'm closing it.
