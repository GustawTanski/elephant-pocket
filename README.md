# Elephant Pocket

**Elephant Pocket** â€” app for managing home budget. Demo available [here](https://elephant-pocket.surge.sh/).

## Project cancelled

This project has been launched in educational purposes only. I've started it about a year ago and stopped developing in Dec 2019, because I've started writing app for my degree ([you can find it here](https://github.com/GustawTanski/christoffel-symbols-visualization)). There is no point in relaunching it now though I'm closing it.

## Used technologies
- Typescript 
- Express
- MongoDB
- React
- Redux
- Mongoose
- styled-components
- Jest (only on server side)

The backend has been developed to be an adaptation of *ports and adapters* architecture.
